# Genealogy

Genealogy (the study and tracing of lines of descent) is well-established for tracing and monitoring family links.  When a genealogist inquires about the great-grandmother of person X, they would ideally want to receive a collection of images as well as the individual's name. This project will develop a system that connects family tree information to an image archive and the metadata associated with the pictures.

The project's two main components are a family history database that will retain information on individuals such as their name, birth date, death date, gender, occupation, and many other things. The relationship will include parent-child relationships, marriage, and divorce. The media archive handles metadata for many types of media. We define "media" as images, but it might also refer to other types of media such as videos. It comprises the filename, date when the photo was taken, location, tags, and persons visible in the picture for each image in the collection.
