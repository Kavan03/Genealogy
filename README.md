# Genealogy

Genealogy (the study and tracing of lines of descent) is well-established for tracing and monitoring family links.  When a genealogist inquires about the great-grandmother of person X, they would ideally want to receive a collection of images as well as the individual's name. This project will develop a system that connects family tree information to an image archive and the metadata associated with the pictures.

The project's two main components are a family history database that will retain information on individuals such as their name, birth date, death date, gender, occupation, and many other things. The relationship will include parent-child relationships, marriage, and divorce. The media archive handles metadata for many types of media. We define "media" as images, but it might also refer to other types of media such as videos. It comprises the filename, date when the photo was taken, location, tags, and persons visible in the picture for each image in the collection.

Key Features
Family Tree Management:
• Enables users to input and maintain detailed ancestral and descendant data.
• Tracks relationships between individuals, offering a clear and interactive view of family connections.

Image Integration:
• Links family tree entries to an image repository, allowing users to upload and associate pictures with specific individuals.
• Metadata tagging enables sorting and retrieval of images based on time periods or familial connections.

Search & Exploration Tools:
• Provides insights into an individual’s relations, including ancestors, descendants, and other connections.
• Facilitates queries like retrieving family images from a specific time frame or visualizing direct relations.

Technologies & Development Highlights
• Developed a robust backend using Java, ensuring scalability and efficient data processing.
• Implemented a metadata tagging system to streamline the association of images with family tree entries.
• Designed intuitive tools to enhance data exploration and simplify complex family relationship analysis.

This project demonstrates expertise in building data-driven applications, emphasizing relational data management and integration of multimedia resources. It showcases skills in backend development, object-oriented programming, and creating tools for enhanced data usability.
